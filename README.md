# Minimum Viable Synth, Version 5

*The Minimum Viable Synth is dead, long live the Minimum Viable
 Synth!*

I am starting over on the egregiously misnamed Minimum Viable Synth.
In large part it's because I found Will Pirkle's textbook,
[**Designing Software Synthesizer Plug-Ins in
C++](https://www.willpirkle.com/synthbook/).  Also, I've got a Teensy
4.0 that I want to use, and I've also pledged for the [Electrosmith
Daisy Kickstarter
campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/electro-smith/daisy-an-embedded-platform-for-music),
and I want the MVS to run on these.
